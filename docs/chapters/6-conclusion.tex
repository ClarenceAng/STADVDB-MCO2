\section{Conclusion}

% Gives (i) a short recap of your work (project) with the key strategies employed, and (ii) relevant findings.

% TODO: Write conclusion summarizing:
% - Project overview and objectives achieved
% - Key strategies employed (update strategy, replication strategy, recovery strategy)
% - Main findings from concurrency control experiments
% - Main findings from failure recovery experiments
% - Contributions and significance of the work

This technical report presented the design, implementation, and evaluation of a three-node distributed database system for managing concurrent transactions. The system employed [describe key strategies]:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Fragmentation:} [Describe approach used]
    \item \textbf{Replication Strategy:} [Describe approach used]
    \item \textbf{Update Strategy:} [Describe approach used]
    \item \textbf{Recovery Strategy:} [Describe approach used]
\end{itemize}

Key findings from our experiments include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Finding 1 regarding concurrency control
    \item Finding 2 regarding isolation levels
    \item Finding 3 regarding failure recovery
    \item Finding 4 regarding system performance
\end{enumerate}

% TODO: Add concluding remarks about the importance of the work and potential future improvements
