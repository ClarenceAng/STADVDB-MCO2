% TODO: Give a general overview of distributed databases and their usage.
% Cite related literature for your definition of terms.

Distributed databases have become essential in modern computing environments where data needs to be accessed and managed across multiple geographical locations while maintaining consistency and availability. A distributed database management system (DDBMS) ensures that changes, additions, and deletions performed on data at any given location are automatically reflected in the data stored at all other locations, providing users with a consistent view of the data across the entire system.

% TODO: Narrow down to your specific use case
% - What is your paper all about?
% - Why build a distributed database?
% - How does your web application manage the access to the distributed database across the 3 nodes?

\subsection{Objectives}
% List the objectives of the project
The objectives of this project are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To design and implement a three-node distributed database system with appropriate data fragmentation and replication strategies.
    \item To develop and evaluate concurrency control mechanisms that maintain data consistency across concurrent transactions.
    \item To implement global failure recovery strategies that support continued database availability during node failures.
    \item To analyze the trade-offs between different isolation levels in supporting concurrent transactions.
\end{enumerate}
