\section{Discussion}

% Present your findings vis-a-vis the learnings and insights gained from the conduct of your experiments/simulations.
% Focus on two key aspects: (i) concurrency and update strategy, and (ii) recovery strategy.

\subsection{Importance of Distributed Databases}
% What is the importance of distributed databases?

% TODO: Discuss the benefits and importance
% - Scalability
% - Availability
% - Fault tolerance
% - Geographic distribution

\subsection{Concurrency and Isolation Levels}
% How do proper isolation levels allow transactions to be executed concurrently?

% TODO: Discuss findings from isolation level experiments
% - Trade-offs between consistency and throughput
% - Appropriate use cases for each isolation level

\subsection{Data Fragmentation and Replication}
% Why are data fragmentation and replication necessary?
% How do these affect data consistency and recovery?

% TODO: Discuss findings
% - Benefits of horizontal fragmentation
% - Replication for fault tolerance
% - Impact on consistency

\subsection{Benefits of Replication During Node Failure}
% How do data replication benefit users even when a node fails?

% TODO: Discuss high availability through replication

\subsection{Data Transparency}
% How is data transparency supported by your data replication and update strategy?

% TODO: Discuss location transparency, replication transparency, fragmentation transparency

\subsection{Facilities for Node Recovery}
% What facilities need to be in place to support node recovery?

% TODO: Discuss required components
% - Transaction logs
% - Checkpoint mechanisms
% - Synchronization protocols

\subsection{Lessons Learned}
% Additional insights and lessons from the project

% TODO: Share practical insights from implementation
